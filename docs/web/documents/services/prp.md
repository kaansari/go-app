Discover Your Radiant Self with PRP in Chicago Loop
Platelet-Rich-Plasma (PRP) is a regenerative treatment that utilizes the healing properties found in a patient’s own blood. During the procedure, a small sample of blood is drawn from the patient and the processed to isolate the platelets and growth factors. These concentrated platelets are then injected back into the targeted area, such as the face, scalp, or joints, to stimulate tissue repair and regeneration. PRP therapy is known for its ability to promote collagen production, improve skin texture and tone, stimulate hair growth, and reduce inflammation. It’s a natural and safe treatment option with minimal risk of adverse reactions since it harnesses the body’s own healing mechanisms.
