# WHY PLATELETS ARE THE MOST NATURAL AND EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR THE UNDER EYE AREA

## THE POWER OF PLATELETS FOR FACIAL REJUVENATION:
Want an all-natural, safe, and effective treatment? Platelets may be your answer. 

As the proverb goes, “the eyes are the window to the soul”. So much attention is focused on the eyes. The under eye area is a common “concern” area. This is because the skin under the eyes is extremely thin and begins to sag and wrinkle as we age. For people who have dark shadows or under eye hollowing, there is lack of subcutaneous fat beneath this skin. Thus, muscle which lies directly below the skin, causes purplish discoloration below the eyes.  

Other common areas of concern include the nasolabial folds (lines between the nose and lips) and wrinkles around the lips caused by gradual loss of collagen/elastin, shrinking fat pads, sagging ligaments, and constant muscle contractions. 

What can we do to combat this aging process? Well, let’s get to the root cause. What’s our strategy?

- Thicken the skin (improve collagen and elastin)
- Tighten the skin (reverse wrinkles)
- Prevent wrinkles (relax the muscles)
- Prevent sagging (strengthen the ligaments)
- Replenish the lost volume 

While we have many therapies for each one of these five categories. Let’s talk about one that can address four out of the five. 

## WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF PLATELETS (PRP OR PRFM)?
Platelets are our body’s first responders to injury. They activate a cascade of physiological mechanisms conducive to healing and regeneration of tissues. Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) and Platelet Rich Fibrin Matrix (PRFM) release growth factors, stem cells and cytokines (cell messengers), which signal tissues to regenerate, restore and rebuild skin cells. PRP and PRFM procedures are utilized in aesthetic medicine to restore skin collagen and elastin, thus improving skin quality and overall healthy appearance.  

## WHY IS PRFM BETTER THAN PRP?
PRP (Platelet Rich Plasma) contains 5 times greater amount of platelets than the blood circulating in the human body; while the concentration of platelets in PRFM is 10 times greater. PRP remains in the injected area for about 24 hours; whereas PRFM stays productive in the area for one week to slowly release growth factors necessary for restoration of skin tissues. PRFM requires less blood volume compared to PRP, exerts more healing factors, while inflicting less trauma to individual cells.

## HOW IS THE PRFM TREATMENT PERFORMED?
The process begins with a blood draw. The blood is collected into tubes which are spun at a very high speed in a centrifuge. This process separates blood cells (red cells, white cells) from plasma, which contains activated platelets, growth factors, stem cells, and cell messengers. PRP is then transferred into a tube which contains calcium chloride which converts the PRP into PRFM (Platelet Rich Fibrin Matrix). PRFM turns into a gel-like matrix after about 10 minutes, allowing it actively recruit growth factors and stem cells to promote a healing cascade for one week. 

We use micro cannulas to inject PRP or PRFM into the face or neck. After cleansing the skin area, we numb the skin with Lidocaine and then create an opening or a skin puncture with a needle. Through this opening we insert a cannula, which is a blunt instrument similar to IV catheter. The cannula feels like pressure rather than pain. It is likely for clients to have mild swelling, which gradually improves as the body reabsorbs the  PRP or PRFM. Growth factors, stem cells and cell messengers begin to stimulate the production of new and healthy cells.

## WHY ADD HEALITE?
Ever wonder why a plant grows better with fertilizer and sunlight? Imagine what your tomatoes would look like if it was grown in soil with only water, but no fertilizer or sunlight…it probably wouldn’t produce many tomatoes if any. So add fertilizer but, no sunlight…maybe a bit higher chance of success. Sunlight is what gives your tomato plants energy to produce fruit. 

Red Light Therapy (830 nm near infrared light) boosts the ATP (energy) production in your cells to enhance results and speed recovery. By providing more energy to your cells, you have better recruitment of neutrophils, mast cells, and macrophages that in turn recruit stem cells and growth factors to enhance the healing cascade. Think of platelets as the “fertilizer” and HRed Light Therapy as the “sunlight” needed to ensure a successful treatment.

## WHEN CAN I EXPECT TO SEE RESULTS WITH PRFM?
Platelet therapy produces completely natural results that gradually improves over time. Every individuals’ immune response varies. Typically subtle results can be seen within one month, but continues to gradually improve over six months. 

## HOW MANY PRFM TREATMENTS WILL I NEED?
For the best results, we recommend a series of treatments, two to three treatments four weeks apart. A boost treatment four to six months later will enhance your results. Areas commonly treated include tear trough (under eye) area, but we highly recommend treating the entire face for the optimal results. 

## WHAT SHOULD I DO TO PREPARE FOR TREATMENT WITH PRFM?
We recommend starting to prepare 7-10 days prior to treatment. Eating a well balanced diet, staying well hydrated, and getting plenty of rest will prepare you for production of healthy platelets, which live about seven to ten days. Being well hydrated will increase the amount of circulating blood in your body and will make the blood draw process easier. 24 hours prior to your appointment, please avoid steroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) such as Ibuprofen or Advil. NSAIDs and steroids interfere with the desired inflammatory response of your body, which is intended to regenerate your skin tissue.

## POST-CARE: WHAT SHOULD I DO AFTER TREATMENT WITH PRFM?
To reduce swelling, we recommend staying well hydrated, reducing sodium in your diet and sleeping with the head elevated on a few pillows. Please avoid steroids and NSAID medications (such as Motrin or Advil) for 1 week after the treatment as this will blunt the body’s immune response to the platelet therapy.  

You can further boost your immune system by maintaining a healthy diet, sleep and exercise routine.  We recommend taking Vitamin C (2 gm daily for 1 week) and eating 1 mg/kg of protein.
