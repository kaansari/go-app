## What should I know about Dysport/Botox?

Dysport/Botox is a type of botulinum toxin injection used for various medical and cosmetic purposes. It is primarily used to temporarily improve the appearance of moderate to severe frown lines between the eyebrows (glabellar lines), forehead lines, and crow’s feet lines around the eyes. Dysport works by temporarily relaxing the muscles that cause these wrinkles, resulting in smoother skin.

In NOON Med Spa we mainly use Dysport for:

- **Cosmetic purposes:** Dysport is often used as a cosmetic treatment to reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines on the face, particularly in the forehead and around the eyes.

- **Medical purposes:** Dysport can also be used for medical purposes, such as treating muscle spasms, cervical dystonia (a condition characterized by involuntary muscle contractions in the neck and shoulder muscles), and certain types of movement disorders.

- **Excessive sweating:** Dysport injections can be used to treat hyperhidrosis, a condition characterized by excessive sweating, particularly in the underarms, palms, and soles of the feet.

- **Migraine prevention:** Some studies suggest that Dysport injections may be effective in preventing chronic migraines in adults.

| **What is Dysport and Botox?**                    | Dysport and Botox are injectable neurotoxins containing botulinum toxin type A. They temporarily paralyze muscle activity, reducing wrinkles and fine lines for a smoother appearance. |
| **How do they work?**                             | They block nerve signals in the muscles, preventing them from contracting. This relaxation of muscles smoothens wrinkles caused by repeated facial expressions.                        |
| **What areas can be treated?**                    | Common treatment areas include forehead lines, crow's feet, and frown lines. Both can also be used for eyebrow lifts and jawline contouring.                                    |

| **Is the treatment painful?**                     | Discomfort is minimal. A fine needle is used, and some formulations contain a local anesthetic. Cold packs or numbing cream may be applied to enhance comfort.                   |
| **Are there any side effects?**                   | Possible side effects include temporary bruising, swelling, or redness at the injection site. Rarely, eyelid drooping or asymmetry may occur, but these are usually temporary.    |
| **How soon do I see results?**                    | Initial effects can be noticeable within a few days, with full results appearing within 1-2 weeks. Patience is key for optimal outcomes.                                          |
| **Can Dysport/Botox be combined with other treatments?** | Yes, they can be combined with dermal fillers or other cosmetic procedures for a more comprehensive facial rejuvenation approach.                                                  |
| **Who is a good candidate for these treatments?** | Generally, individuals with dynamic wrinkles and good overall health make good candidates. Pregnant or breastfeeding women should avoid these treatments.                        |
| **How long is the procedure?**                    | The procedure usually takes about 15-30 minutes, making it a convenient option for those with busy schedules.                                                                  |
| **How much do Dysport/Botox treatments cost?**     | Costs vary depending on the provider, location, and the amount of product used. It's typically priced per unit, and the number of units needed varies for each person.          |
| **Is there downtime after the treatment?**        | There's minimal to no downtime. Patients can usually resume regular activities immediately, but it's advised to avoid strenuous exercise on the day of treatment.           |
| **Are the results natural-looking?**              | When administered by a skilled practitioner, the results are generally natural-looking, preserving facial expressions while reducing the appearance of wrinkles.               |
