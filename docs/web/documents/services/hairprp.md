## WHAT IS PRP?
PRP, or “platelet rich plasma” has been used for decades to treat a range of medical conditions, as it has natural healing properties. PRP treatments are an exciting development in the field of aesthetic medicine, including hair restoration. You may have heard of the "Vampire Facial" which uses PRP to restore a vibrant, youthful complexion. PRP has been found to be effective in triggering the body’s natural regenerative processes, stimulating dormant hair follicles to once again produce healthy strands of hair.


## WHAT IS PRP HAIR RESTORATION?
PRP Hair Restoration is a revolutionary, non-surgical technique for natural hair restoration and has become a popular hair rejuvenation treatment for the beginning stages of male and female pattern baldness. PRP is produced through an extraction process, from your own blood cells. This powerful regenerative substance is then meticulously injected into your scalp at various intervals to stimulate the hair follicles.

Our PRP hair restoration is often used in conjunction with other treatments for thinning hair. At NOON Med Spa, each patient can expect a custom-tailored treatment plan to address hair problems and treat thinning or balding areas.

## AM I A CANDIDATE FOR PRP HAIR RESTORATION?
Almost any person who wants to maintain a healthy head of hair is a good candidate for PRP hair restoration. Those who have experienced hair loss at earlier ages are especially responsive to this treatment. Patients who have thinning hair while still retaining functioning hair follicles can see a significant improvement with this treatment.

The best way to learn if PRP hair restoration is the ideal treatment for you is to schedule a consultation with us at NOON MED SPA. Our hair restoration treatments are custom-tailored to match the needs of the individual patient, and PRP hair restoration is often advised in a comprehensive hair restoration treatment plan. Schedule a consultation for arguably the best PRP hair restoration Downtown Chicago, IL has to offer.

## HOW DOES PRP HAIR RESTORATION WORK?
The procedure begins with a blood draw from the patient, in a similar quantity to a routine blood test. The blood is then placed into a centrifuge, where it is spun to separate the red blood cells from the plasma. The remaining plasma is rich in growth factors that naturally stimulate the regrowth in hair follicles that have gone dormant. The PRP is administered below the surface of the scalp through a series of tiny injections. The entire procedure is relatively painless and usually takes about 30 minutes.

These treatments should generally be performed once each month for the first three to four months, and then followed by treatments once every six months for optimal results. Our Doctors/Nurses will evaluate your progress to ensure you are responding to the treatment. Results are typically seen within the first two to three months.

## WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF PRP HAIR RESTORATION?
PRP Hair Restoration has grown in popularity in recent years as a natural way to restore thicker, healthier hair growth in patients with thinning hair. Some medications used to treat male or female pattern baldness, have less-than-desirable side effects. Additionally, some hair growth medications are not recommended for women. The benefits of PRP include:

- Safe and natural
- Fast procedure
- Your own blood cells, so no risk of rejection
- Stimulates body to regenerate dormant hair follicles
- No worries about recovery time

## WHAT IS THE RECOVERY LIKE FROM PRP HAIR RESTORATION?
Since you will be injected with your own nutrient-rich blood, there are essentially no risks associated with PRP hair restoration. The procedure requires little-to-no downtime following treatment, meaning you won't need to take time out of your busy schedule for the treatment. Most patients may return to work the same day they receive injections. There are also very few side effects associated with PRP hair restoration treatment.

### AFTER PRP HAIR RESTORATION
As a matter of caution, you should avoid typical hair maintenance for a day or two following treatment (heat styling, color processing, etc.) to allow the area to heal. A warm shower can increase the blood-flow to the scalp and will provide increased circulation to the scalp, to stimulate the hair follicles and trigger the rejuvenating, regenerative process of your body. There may be some redness at the injection site and slight bruising may occur. Tylenol is recommended following the treatment should you have any discomfort.
