PRP Hair Restoration $350 with microneedling  $550

Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) therapy for hair loss offers a non-surgical solution for individuals seeking hair restoration. Both male and female pattern baldness present as genetic issues that can cause distress and embarrassment. This procedure will help:
Enhances blood supply to the follicle
Increases hair shaft size (thickness of hair)
Stimulates hair growth
Reduces hair loss
Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) therapy for hair restoration involves injecting concentrated platelets from your own blood into the scalp to stimulate hair growth. PRP contains growth factors that can promote hair growth by nourishing hair follicles, improving blood circulation, and stimulating the production of new hair cells.
PRP alone is effective for some individuals, especially those in the early stages of hair loss or those with thinning hair. However, for others, combining PRP with microneedling can enhance its effectiveness.
Microneedling for hair restoration involves using a device with tiny needles to create micro-injuries on the scalp. These micro-injuries stimulate the body's natural wound-healing process, which includes the production of collagen and elastin. When combined with PRP, microneedling can enhance the absorption of the platelets into the scalp, thereby amplifying the therapeutic effects of PRP.
In summary, while PRP alone can be effective for hair restoration, combining it with microneedling can potentially enhance its efficacy by improving the delivery of growth factors to the hair follicles and stimulating collagen production in the scalp.
