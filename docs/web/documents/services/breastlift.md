# What is a Vampire Breast Lift?

A vampire breast lift (VBL) is a procedure to improve (augment) the look of your breasts if surgery isn’t yet warranted. VBL uses injections of platelet-rich plasma (PRP). This procedure is also known as a PRP breast lift.

<br> 

## What is Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP)?

Platelet-rich plasma comes from your blood. PRP contains proteins that promote blood clotting and help with cell growth.

Providers separate PRP from the rest of your blood in a centrifuge, a machine that spins your blood at high speeds. The centrifuge separates your blood into three components:

- Platelet-rich plasma.
- White blood cells.
- Red blood cells.

## Why is a Vampire Breast Lift Done?

People may opt for a PRP breast lift if a surgical breast lift isn’t yet warranted. Providers who inject PRP into their patients’ breasts claim that it:

- Increases elastin (a protein that allows tissue to stretch).
- Promotes growth of collagen (a protein that provides structure to your body).
- Stimulates new cell growth.

A vampire breast lift may help to:

- Improve skin texture and tone.
- Make your breasts look lifted and fuller.
- Reduce the look of wrinkles, stretch marks, and scars.

## Does a Vampire Breast Lift Really Work?

Scientists haven’t studied the effectiveness vampire blood lifts, also known as PRP breast lifts. The long-term side effects and risks aren’t known. If you're considering breast lift options, be sure to consult with a board-certified plastic surgeon or dermatologist about the risks of this particular treatment.

# Procedure Details

## What Happens Before a PRP Breast Lift?

Before a PRP breast lift, you’ll have a consultation with your provider to talk about what you want to achieve. Your provider will:

- Ask about your health history.
- Examine your breasts.
- Discuss your desired outcome from the procedure.

## What Happens During a Vampire Breast Lift?

During a vampire breast lift, your provider will take a blood sample, usually from your arm. They’ll spin the blood in a centrifuge machine to separate the PRP.

Your provider will apply a numbing cream to your breasts to decrease your sensitivity during the procedure. Then they use a thin needle to inject PRP into areas throughout your breasts.

The injections generally take about 20 minutes. The entire procedure usually lasts less than an hour.

## What Happens After a Vampire Breast Lift?

Most people don’t have any side effects after a vampire breast lift. Some people experience side effects for a few days, such as:

- Bruises.
- Swelling.
- Tenderness.

# Risks / Benefits

## What are the Advantages of a Vampire Breast Lift?

People who have a VBL breast lift instead of surgical breast augmentation may have:

- Fewer complications.
- Less pain.
- Shorter recovery time.

## What are the Risks or Complications of a PRP Breast Lift?

You may experience some pain during the blood sample and injections. But any discomfort is usually mild.

Because a PRP breast lift isn’t surgery, it can’t:

- Completely lift saggy breasts.
- Give your breasts a new shape.
- Increase your breast size.
- Reduce excess skin.
- Reposition your nipples.

This procedure isn’t recommended if you’re:

- At high risk of breast cancer or have had breast cancer.
- Breastfeeding.
- Pregnant.

Because there haven’t been scientific studies on vampire breast lifts, the long-term effects aren’t known. It’s also unclear whether a PRP breast lift can affect a mammogram. Be sure to tell your provider about the procedure if you have a mammogram.

# Recovery and Outlook

## What is the Recovery Time After a PRP Breast Lift?

After a PRP breast lift, you may notice your breasts becoming gradually firmer and smoother over a period of three to four weeks. Final results may not appear for two to three months. Any changes can last up to two years.

## When can I Go Back to Work or School, Drive, or Eat?

You can usually return to your regular activities immediately. Your healthcare provider will offer guidance suitable for your recovery.
