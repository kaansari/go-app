# ABOUT SEMAGLUTIDE

The hottest weight loss treatment on the market is available at New Medical Spa!

Semaglutide is a non-surgical, non-invasive weight loss medication. When combined with diet and exercise, it assists with blood sugar control, appetite control, and weight loss! Semaglutide is a long-term solution for weight loss and FDA approved, meaning it’s both effective and safe for men and women. On average, clients can expect to see weight loss of 15% of body mass.

Semaglutide works to regulate blood sugar by helping your body’s insulin release and blocking certain sources of sugar. It aids in digestion function, helping men and women feel full quicker and longer. As a result, your body does not need as much food intake as normal to feel satisfied. Semaglutide, available at New Medical Spa in Short Pump, VA, also speeds up your metabolism, increases fat burning, and helps control appetite and cravings.

Semaglutide is injected into the fat of the belly, thighs, or arms using a tiny needle. Many report this to be a painless, comfortable process. Since this is a weight loss medication, Dr. Teresa Camden will monitor your program and results to ensure you’re on the optimal path for your health, wellness, and goals!
